   ```
   This will start a local web server and open the app in your default browser.

2. The app will automatically load trending repositories and begin showing recommendations.

3. Use the sidebar to explore different categories or topics.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 with custom properties and animations
- Vanilla JavaScript with modern ES6+ features
- GitHub REST API
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Marked.js for Markdown rendering
- Font Awesome for icons
- Local storage for persistent settings

## Technical Implementation

The application is built using a modular architecture with the following components:

- State Management: Centralized application state with persistence
- UI Components: Modular, reusable components for consistent UI
- API Integration: Efficient fetching and caching of GitHub API data
- Event Handling: Comprehensive event listeners for user interactions
- Responsive Design: CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptive layouts
- Error Handling: Graceful error recovery and user feedback

## Performance Optimizations

- Repository data caching to minimize API calls
- Lazy loading of detailed repository information
- Efficient DOM manipulation with document fragments
- Debounced search input for reduced API requests
- Pagination to handle large result sets

## Limitations

- GitHub API has rate limits (60 requests/hour for unauthenticated users)
- Repository data is public information only, no access to private repositories
- No write operations to GitHub (e.g., starring, forking)
- Limited to GitHub API's available endpoints

## Future Roadmap

- GitHub OAuth authentication for higher API rate limits
- Advanced filtering options (license, owner type, etc.)
- Repository comparison feature
- Code search within repositories
- Trending developers section
- Weekly/monthly email digests of recommended repositories
- Browser extension for seamless integration
- PWA support for offline access
- Mobile app versions for iOS and Android
